excerpt: 'This study seeks to address the gaps by examining how adolescent SPS moderates the role of parent-adolescent relationships on adolescent rumination, a risk factor for internalizing problems, in a group of Chinese adolescents. We examined both positive and negative ranges of the relationship (conflict vs. support) and evaluated the issue with both mothers and fathers.'
