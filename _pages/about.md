I am a Ph.D. student in Developmental Psychology working with Dr. Koraly Pérez-Edgar in the [Cognition, Affect, and Temperament Lab](https://www.catlabpsu.com), planning to pursue a dual-title degree in Social Data Analytics.

## Education
Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology, Pennsylvania State University <span style="float:right;">2025–Present</span> 
*Advisor: Dr. Koraly Pérez-Edgar*

B.S. in Psychology, Peking University <span style="float:right;">2020–2025</span>

## Research Interest
My research focuses on how children internally process social feedback (e.g., evaluating different types of feedback, updating expectations) and how these processes relate to psychopathology. I am particularly interested in individual differences and within-person or dyadic dynamics. Methodologically, I enjoy using computational modeling to study behavior, but I am also open to incorporating other approaches, such as EEG, fMRI, and biological data, when appropriate.

## Previous Experience
As an undergraduate, I worked with Dr. Ka Ip (University of Minnesota) on neighborhood influences on brain structure; Dr. Zhi Li (Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester) on parent-child relationships and children’s sensory processing sensitivity; Dr. Yujia Peng (Peking University) on cognitive processes in social anxiety; and Dr. Yinyin Zang (Peking University) on adolescent interventions.

Outside of research, I survive on three nutrients: board games, drums, and travel.
