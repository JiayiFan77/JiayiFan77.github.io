I am a Ph.D. student in Developmental Psychology at Pennsylvania State University, working with Dr. Koraly Pérez-Edgar in the [Cognition, Affect, and Temperament Lab](https://www.catlabpsu.com), and planning to pursue a dual-title degree in Social Data Analytics.

## Research Interest
### For research Questions
**Social Feedback**, **Expectation**
My current research focuses on how children internally process social feedback. For example, how children differentiate between different types of social feedback, how they generate expectations of social feedback, and how this feedback updates their internal representations of self and others. I am particularly interested in the role of family in this process. 

**Individual Differences**, **Within-person Dynamics**
Another dimension of my research is understanding within-person processes. I aim to characterize individual differences in cognitive and social processes and examine how these differences relate to temperament, personality traits, and psychopathology. Additionally, I study real-time dynamics of social interactions at the trial-by-trial level, with the goal of unfolding the processes underlying behavior and social interaction.


For research method and pathway: Methodologically, I enjoy using computational modeling to study behavior, but I am also open to incorporating other approaches, such as EEG, fMRI, and biological data, when appropriate.

## Previous Experience
As an undergraduate, I worked with Dr. Ka Ip (University of Minnesota) on neighborhood influences on brain structure; Dr. Zhi Li (Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester) on parent-child relationships and children’s sensory processing sensitivity; Dr. Yujia Peng (Peking University) on cognitive processes in social anxiety; and Dr. Yinyin Zang (Peking University) on adolescent interventions.

Outside of research, I survive on three nutrients: board games, drums, and travel.
