Jiayi Fan is a Ph.D. student in Developmental Psychology working with Dr. Koraly Pérez-Edgar in the {Cognition, Affect, and Temperament Lab](https://www.catlabpsu.com), planning to pursue a dual-title degree in Social Data Analytics. She began her doctoral studies in 2025 after earning a B.S. in Psychology from Peking University. 

## Research Interest
Jiayi’s research focuses on how children internally process social feedback (e.g., evaluating different types of feedback, updating expectations) and how these processes relate to psychopathology. She is particularly interested in individual differences and within-person or dyadic dynamics. Methodologically, she enjoys using computational modeling to study behavior, but she is also open to incorporating other approaches, such as EEG, fMRI, and biological data, when appropriate. Outside of research, Jiayi survives on three nutrients: board games, drums, and travel.

## Previous Experience
As an undergraduate, she worked with Dr. Ka Ip (University of Minnesota) on neighborhood influences on brain structure; Dr. Zhi Li (Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester) on parent-child relationships and children’s sensory processing sensitivity; Dr. Yujia Peng (Peking University) on cognitive processes in social anxiety; and Dr. Yinyin Zang (Peking University) on adolescent interventions.
