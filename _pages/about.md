Jiayi Fan is a first-year Ph.D. student in the CAT Lab, with plans to pursue a dual-title degree in Social Data Analytics. Jiayi’s research focuses on how children internally process social feedback (e.g., evaluating different types of feedback, updating expectations) and how these processes relate to psychopathology. She is particularly interested in individual differences and within-person or dyadic dynamics. Methodologically, she enjoys using computational modeling to study behavior, but she is also open to incorporating other approaches, such as EEG, fMRI, and biological data, when appropriate. Outside of research, Jiayi survives on three nutrients: board games, drums, and travel.
