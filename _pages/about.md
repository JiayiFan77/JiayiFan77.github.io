I am a Ph.D. student in Developmental Psychology at Pennsylvania State University, working with Dr. Koraly Pérez-Edgar in the [Cognition, Affect, and Temperament Lab](https://www.catlabpsu.com), and planning to pursue a dual-title degree in Social Data Analytics.

## Research Interest
*For Research Questions* 

My current research focuses on how children internally process <span style="color:#3CB5A5; font-weight:bold;">**social feedback**</span>. For example, how children differentiate between different types of social feedback, how they generate expectations of social feedback, and how this feedback updates their internal representations of self and others. I am particularly interested in the role of family in this process. 

Another dimension of my research adopts a person-centered perspective. On one hand, I aim to characterize **<span style="color:#3CB5A5; font-weight:bold;">individual differences</span>** in cognitive and social processes and examine how these differences relate to temperament, personality traits, and developmental psychopathology. On the other hand, I investigate real-time **<span style="color:#3CB5A5; font-weight:bold;">dynamics</span>** of social interactions at the second-by-second level, as well as trial-by-trial changes in personal cognition, with the goal of uncovering the mechanisms underlying social interaction and individual behavior.

*For Research Methods*

<span style="font-size: 12px;">*Notes*: for preference, 1 = object to using it; 5 = neutral, will use only when necessary; 9 = big fan, will follow anything relevant;  
for proficiency, 1 = no knowledge, need to learn from scratch;  5 = basic knowledge, can read but cannot use independently; 7 = fluent, can use comfortably; 9 = mother tongue, ask me and I’ll happily help!</span>

My advisor uses a metaphor to describe research methods as languages: for example, a mother tongue, a fluent language, a language one can read but not speak, or an unfamiliar language. I adopt the same metaphor to introduce my research methodology. As an early-stage researcher, I consider both my preference and proficiency for each method.

# Previous Experience
As an undergraduate, I worked with Dr. Ka Ip (University of Minnesota) on neighborhood influences on brain structure; Dr. Zhi Li (Mt. Hope Family Center, University of Rochester) on parent-child relationships and children’s sensory processing sensitivity; Dr. Yujia Peng (Peking University) on cognitive processes in social anxiety; and Dr. Yinyin Zang (Peking University) on adolescent interventions.

Outside of research, I survive on three nutrients: board games, drums, and travel.
